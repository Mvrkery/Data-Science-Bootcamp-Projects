## Pizza Ordering ChatBot Project

- This project is a chatbot that allows users to order pizzas. The chatbot first asks the user if they would like to order a pizza. If the user says yes, the chatbot then asks the user for their preferred pizza size. Once the user has selected a size, the chatbot asks the user what toppings they would like. The chatbot then confirms the user's order and asks if the user is satisfied. If the user is satisfied, the chatbot thanks the user for their order and says that their pizza will be delivered shortly. If the user is not satisfied, the chatbot cancels the order.

## Rock Paper Scissors Bot Project
[Click here](https://replit.com/@athiwatsirinant/RockPaperScissorBotProject) to see how my Rock Paper Scissors Bot project works on replit.com!
- This project is a game of rock-paper-scissors against a computer. The game begins by asking the user for their name. The game then prompts the user to choose from rock, paper, or scissors. The computer then randomly chooses one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner of the round is determined by the rules of rock-paper-scissors. The game continues until the user decides to quit. At the end of the game, the game displays the user's wins, losses, and ties.

## NYCflights13-Analysis-With-DPLYR-Project
- The R code you provided analyzes the `nycflights13` dataset to identify Total number of flights, the top 5 most popular airlines, Popular Airlines Of 2013, the average departure delay for each airline, and the top 5 destinations with the most flights. It does this by filtering and manipulating the data using the `dplyr` package, and then printing the results using the `arrange()` and `View()` functions.
