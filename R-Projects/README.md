# Here is a description of the two projects
## Pizza Ordering ChatBot Project
- This project is a chatbot that allows users to order pizzas. The chatbot first asks the user if they would like to order a pizza. If the user says yes, the chatbot then asks the user what size of pizza they would like (small, medium, or large). Once the user has selected a size, the chatbot asks the user what toppings they would like. The chatbot then confirms the user's order and asks if the user is satisfied. If the user is satisfied, the chatbot thanks the user for their order and says that their pizza will be delivered shortly. If the user is not satisfied, the chatbot cancels the order.

## Rock Paper Scissors Bot Project
- This project is a game of rock-paper-scissors against a computer. The game begins by asking the user for their name. The game then prompts the user to choose from rock, paper, or scissors. The computer then randomly chooses from rock, paper, or scissors. The winner of the round is determined by the rules of rock-paper-scissors. The game continues until the user decides to quit. At the end of the game, the game displays the user's wins, losses, and ties.
