# Italian Restaurant Database and SQL Project
## The Italian Restaurant Database that I have created consists of five tables:

- Categories

  This table stores the different categories of food items that are available on the menu, such as Appetizers, Pasta, Pizza, Main Courses, and Desserts.

- Menu
  
  This table stores the individual food items on the menu, along with their categories and prices.

- Customers
  
   This table stores information about the customers who patronize the restaurant, such as their name and type (Regular or VIP).

- Services :

  This table stores the different types of services that the restaurant offers, such as Dine-In, Takeout, Delivery, and Catering.

- Orders

 This table stores information about the orders that have been placed at the restaurant, such as the customer's name, the menu item ordered, the amount paid, and the service type used.

## I have also executed a number of SQL queries to analyze the data in the database, including:

- The Average Order Amount For Each Service Type

    This query calculates the average order amount for each type of service that the restaurant offers. The results of the query show that Dine-In orders have the highest average order amount, followed by Catering, Delivery, and Takeout orders.

- Total Amount Of Sales For Each Customer

    This query calculates the total amount of sales for each customer. The results of the query show that VIP customers spend significantly more than Regular customers.

- The Most Popular Menu Items (Top 3)

    This query identifies the three most popular menu items, based on the number of times they have been ordered. The results of the query show that the Chicken Parmesan, Spaghetti Carbonara, and Fettuccine Alfredo are the most popular menu items.

- The Revenue For Each Category And Service Type Combination

    This query calculates the revenue for each category and service type combination. The results of the query show that Dine-In orders for Main Courses generate the highest revenue, followed by Catering orders for Main Courses, Dine-In orders for Pizza, and Catering orders for Pizza.

- Identify VIP customers who have placed high-value orders

    This query identifies VIP customers who have placed orders with a total value of greater than 100. The results of the query show that Sophia Bianchi, Matteo Ricci, and Alessia Marchetti are the VIP customers who have placed the highest-value orders.

Overall, the Italian Restaurant Database that I have created is an well-designed and informative database. The SQL queries that I have executed provide valuable insights into the restaurant's operations and customer behavior.
