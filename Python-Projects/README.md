# Here is a description of the projects

## Data Quality class workbook Project

- This Jupyter notebook covers the topic of data quality, including what it is, why it is important, how to assess it, and how to improve it. The notebook also includes a number of exercises that students can complete to practice their data quality skills.
   
#### What I learned

- What data quality is and why it is important
- How to identify common data quality issues
- How to use Python to clean and improve your data
- How to assess the quality of your data using a variety of metrics
- How to develop a data quality pipeline to ensure that your data is always high quality

## Final Project Analyzing Sales Data Project

- Final Project is a course project template that can be used to learn the basics of Pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis and manipulation. The course project template includes a set of instructions and a sample dataset that can be used to complete the project.

#### The course project is divided into three parts:

- Data Exploration: In this part of the project, you will use Pandas to explore the sample dataset. You will learn how to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, how to view the DataFrame's contents, and how to calculate basic descriptive statistics.
- Data Cleaning: In this part of the project, you will use Pandas to clean the sample dataset. You will learn how to identify and remove errors from the dataset, how to fill in missing values, and how to convert data types.
- Data Analysis: In this part of the project, you will use Pandas to perform data analysis on the sample dataset. You will learn how to create groups of data, how to calculate aggregations over groups of data, and how to visualize data using Pandas' built-in plotting tools.

## Object Oriented Programming ATM Projrct

 The Object Oriented Programming ATM is a Project that demonstrates how to use object-oriented programming (OOP) to create an ATM simulation in Python.

#### The notebook also includes a complete implementation of an ATM simulation in Python. The simulation includes the following features:

- Account creation: Customers can create new accounts and deposit money into them.
- Withdrawals: Customers can withdraw money from their accounts.
- Transfers: Customers can transfer money between their accounts.
- Balance inquiries: Customers can check the balance of their accounts.

## Rock-Scissor-Paper-Game Project
 The notebook also includes a complete implementation of a rock-scissor-paper game in Python. The game is simple to play: the user chooses rock, scissor, or paper, and the computer also chooses one of these three options. The winner is determined by the following rules:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock
If both players choose the same option, then the game is a tie

The game also includes a scoring system: the player who wins a round gets 1 point. The first player to reach 3 points wins the game.

The notebook also includes a number of exercises that you can complete to practice your Python skills.
