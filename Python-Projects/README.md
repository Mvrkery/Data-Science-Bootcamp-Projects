- How to identify common data quality issues
- How to use Python to clean and improve your data
- How to assess the quality of your data using a variety of metrics
- How to develop a data quality pipeline to ensure that your data is always high quality

## Final Project Analyzing Sales Data Project

-Final Project is a course project template that can be used to learn the basics of Pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis and manipulation. The course project template includes a set of instructions and a sample dataset that can be used to complete the project.

## The course project is divided into three parts:

- Data Exploration: In this part of the project, you will use Pandas to explore the sample dataset. You will learn how to load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, how to view the DataFrame's contents, and how to calculate basic descriptive statistics.
- Data Cleaning: In this part of the project, you will use Pandas to clean the sample dataset. You will learn how to identify and remove errors from the dataset, how to fill in missing values, and how to convert data types.
- Data Analysis: In this part of the project, you will use Pandas to perform data analysis on the sample dataset. You will learn how to create groups of data, how to calculate aggregations over groups of data, and how to visualize data using Pandas' built-in plotting tools.
