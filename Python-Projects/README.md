# Here is a description of the projects

## Data Quality class workbook Project

- This Jupyter notebook covers the topic of data quality, including what it is, why it is important, how to assess it, and how to improve it.

- Data quality is the measure of how well data meets its intended use. It is important because high-quality data can lead to better decision-making and improved results.

- This notebook includes a number of exercises that students can complete to practice their data quality skills. The exercises cover a range of topics, including identifying data quality issues, cleaning data, and improving data quality.
   
## Final Project Analyzing Sales Data Project

- This Datalore project template can be used to learn the basics of Pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis and manipulation. Pandas provides a number of data structures and functions that make it easy to work with data in Python.

- The course project template includes a set of instructions and a sample dataset that can be used to complete the project. The instructions cover a range of topics, including loading data into a Pandas DataFrame, cleaning data, and analyzing data.

## Object Oriented Programming ATM Project

 - This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use object-oriented programming (OOP) to create an ATM simulation in Python. OOP is a programming paradigm that allows you to create reusable code and model real-world objects.

- The ATM simulation in this notebook includes the following features:

- Account creation: Users can create new accounts and deposit money into them.
- Withdrawals: Users can withdraw money from their accounts.
- Transfers: Users can transfer money between their accounts.
- Balance inquiries: Users can check the balance of their accounts.

## Rock-Scissor-Paper-Game Project
 - This Jupyter notebook implements a rock-scissor-paper game in Python. Rock-scissor-paper is a two-player game in which each player chooses one of three shapes: rock, scissors, or paper. The winner of the game is determined by the following rules:
- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock
- If both players choose the same shape, then the game is a tie.
- The rock-scissor-paper game in this notebook is implemented using a number of Python concepts, including functions, loops, and conditional statements.

## Pizza Ordering Chatbot Project

- This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to create a pizza ordering chatbot in Python. A chatbot is a computer program that can simulate conversation with humans.
- The pizza ordering chatbot in this notebook can understand what the user wants to order and place the order for them. The chatbot uses a number of Python concepts, including natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## Pokemon-API-Request
- This Datalore project demonstrates how to make requests to public APIs. An API is a set of rules that define how computers communicate with each other.

- This project uses the Pokemon API as an example, but the same techniques can be used to make requests to any public API. The project includes instructions on how to install the necessary libraries, make a request to the API, and parse the response.

## simple ML model using sklearn Project
- This Datalore project demonstrates how to create a simple machine learning model to predict the price of a house using sklearn. Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a popular Python library for machine learning.

- This project uses a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on a number of features, such as the size of the house and the number of bedrooms. The project includes instructions on how to load the data, prepare the data, train the model, and evaluate the model.
